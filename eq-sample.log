But this is not the place. Not the place. Before you can come to understand your role, you must first understand your world. Take these. They will teach you some. And this. Read it. It is the first step down a long, winding path. You may be lost along the way, but the goal is worth the sacrifice. Trust me. After all, am I not simply a figment of your own mind? A dream? Trust me. You have no other choice.'

[Mon Jul 20 19:58:10 2020] a grey wolf glares at you threateningly -- looks like quite a gamble.
[Mon Jul 20 19:58:39 2020] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
[Mon Jul 20 19:58:54 2020] You have entered Southern Newport.
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:06 2020] Uoros says, 'Hail, a Newport Wizard'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:06 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'Take care, Human. I notice that you are not yet marked for use of the travel portal system. I am permitted to mark you for entrance but first you should know what you are dealing with.'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:07 2020] Uoros says, 'What do I need to know?'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:07 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'Behind me lies a travel portal. A travel portal is a stable portal - a way to instantaneously go from one point to another, but without the constant expenditure of power required to create temporary portals in the way wizards such as myself do. Stable portals are incredibly difficult to create for travel any longer than a few hundred metres - which is why we had to make use of something that was already in place to set up the Travel Portals.'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:08 2020] The attending wizard looks at you in alarm.  'Wait!  You have no idea how dangerous that is!'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:08 2020] Uoros says, 'What do you mean, Make use of something already in place"'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:08 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'The travel portal leads to one of the few remnants of the ruined Lands of Magic - an artificial plane created by the God Malath. The place we utilize has been named the Mansion of Portals. Our best guess is that it was being constructed as a city for Malath's Akheva before he was killed. Regardless what Malath's intent was in its construction it sits today in between our dimension and the dimension the Akheva originated in. It is this unique half existence that allows us to keep stable portals open to the mansion. The Mansion of Portals is an apex of magical energy, a place where reality bends easily to the whims of the arcane. Then there is the Akheva...'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:10 2020] Uoros says, 'The Akheva?'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:10 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'The Mansion itself seems to be somewhat sentient yet unaware of people from our dimension traipsing through. The Akheva that walk its halls seem much more dangerous. They seem to become increasingly aware of who and what we are the longer we stay in the mansion and the more of them we come into contact with. They must be avoided if you do not wish the attention of the entire mansion. Once you have been noticed it is very likely you will not make it out alive. Portal travel is not for the cowardly or the light at heart - yet it can get you to your destination hours or days faster than by foot. Are you sure you wish to be marked for portal travel?'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2020] You say, 'Hail, a Newport Wizard'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'Take care, Human. I notice that you are not yet marked for use of the travel portal system. I am permitted to mark you for entrance but first you should know what you are dealing with.'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2020] - [D1] What do I need to know?
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2020] - [D2] I have no time for this! Mark me and let me be on my way!
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2020] Uoros says, 'I am ready. Mark me for portal travel.'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'So be it, Uoros. Keep your wits about you while you are in the mansion yet always remember the danger. You will literally be in a plane of existence that hates your very presence there. Good luck and safe travels.'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:12 2020] You say, 'I have no time for this! Mark me and let me be on my way!'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:12 2020] a Newport Wizard says, 'So be it. Do not say you were not warned! I am sure the Akhevan spirits will love you.'
[Mon Jul 20 20:00:12 2020] (NOTE: You have been flagged for travel portal use. Good luck!)

[Tue Jul 21 19:11:04 2020] - [D1] Trouble? Brownie?
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:05 2020] You say, 'Trouble? Brownie?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:05 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'Aye. She sneaks in from the Faydark from time to time, skulks up in the trees or on rooftops. She calls herself Hazel. Wee, little thing, as brownies tend to be, and impish, too. I call her 'the shrew' on account of her personality.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:05 2020] - [D1] She must be a piece of work to have earned that nickname. What business does she have in Athica? And what does she have to do with you?

[Tue Jul 21 19:11:07 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'At first, she seemed content to spy on us cityfolk. She's so sneaky, in fact, that I'm the only one who's noticed her! Being a sanitation worker, I'm more perceptive of the cityscape than most, you see. And the more I noticed her, the more she took an interest in me. Last week, an arrow whizzed past my ear as I was scrubbing the bridge. I looked up to see Hazel giggling at me with a mean, little grin on her mean, little face. Ever since then, she's made a game of flinging arrows at me just to laugh at my panic. Oh, she's made my work a miserable affair! She's a good shot, though I hate to admit it, but one of these days she's bound to miss her mark and pin an arrow in me!'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:07 2020] - [D1] Athica is well defended. Why haven't haven't you notified the guards of this problem? Surely, they'd help.

[Tue Jul 21 19:11:08 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'That was the very first thing I did! But two things are working against me. First, the wretched brownie herself ducks out of view whenever she sees the guards coming. And second, brownie arrows are enchanted to disappear after they hit their mark. With no evidence to show them, the guards won't take my seriously. Half of them think I'm a paranoid milksop and the other half thing I'm trying to get out of my work duties. Curse that Hazel!'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:08 2020] - [D1] Perhaps I can help you.
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:09 2020] You say, 'Perhaps I can help you.'

[Tue Jul 21 19:11:09 2020] - [D1] If she's fond of attacking from afar, then I'll give her a dose of her own medicine. I may not have any magic, but I can stock up on ranged weaponry. Maybe if I rough her up a bit, I can scare her out of town once and for all.

[Tue Jul 21 19:11:11 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'I reckon that might work. Oh, to see the look on the shrew's face when she finally gets what's coming to her! Just don't kill her, alright? As mean as she is, I wouldn't want that on my conscience.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:11 2020] - [D1] Agreed. Where can I find her, this Hazel? I take it you've seen her recently, given that you've taken cover in this hallway.
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:13 2020] You say, 'Agreed. Where can I find her, this Hazel? I take it you've seen her recently, given that you've taken cover in this hallway.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:13 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'You make it sound like I'm cowering! Though I suppose I am, because you're right -- I have seen her today. In fact, she's right outside, lurking atop of one of the spires overlooking the bridge. You might get a good view of her if you go up the ramp to my right. There's a ledge there with a commanding view of the city entrance.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:13 2020] - [D1] Say, what's in that bucket you're carrying?
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:15 2020] You say, 'Say, what's in that bucket you're carrying?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:15 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'These? They're specially treated stones. I cast them into the moat from time to time to keep the algae under control. Hey! If you need some ammunition, why not take a fistful of them to throw at that cheeky shrew? I expect most of them will fall into the moat anyway, so you'd be doing me two favors in one.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:15 2020] - [D1] That's a good idea. I believe I'll take some of those stones.
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:15 2020] - [D2] I'd prefer to deal with the brownie using my own means.
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:20 2020] You say, 'That's a good idea. I believe I'll take some of those stones.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:20 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'Help yourself. Now, go teach that brownie a lesson!'

[Tue Jul 21 19:11:32 2020] Wocas says, 'Hail, Caynid Brightwater'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:32 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'What do you want? Come to have a laugh at old Caynid like everyone else? No... wait. You're young enough that you don't yet have a chip on your shoulder. Can I help you? Surely, you haven't come to the city's moat cleaner just to chitchat.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:33 2020] Wocas says, 'Why shouldn't I want to chat with you? You don't seem like a bad fellow.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:33 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'Thanks for saying so. Forgive me for being so cynical, but ever since this trouble with the brownie came up, it's been harder and harder to do my job of keeping the city clean.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:34 2020] Wocas says, 'Trouble? Brownie?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:34 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'Aye. She sneaks in from the Faydark from time to time, skulks up in the trees or on rooftops. She calls herself Hazel. Wee, little thing, as brownies tend to be, and impish, too. I call her 'the shrew' on account of her personality.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:35 2020] Wocas says, 'She must be a piece of work to have earned that nickname. What business does she have in Athica? And what does she have to do with you?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:35 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'At first, she seemed content to spy on us cityfolk. She's so sneaky, in fact, that I'm the only one who's noticed her! Being a sanitation worker, I'm more perceptive of the cityscape than most, you see. And the more I noticed her, the more she took an interest in me. Last week, an arrow whizzed past my ear as I was scrubbing the bridge. I looked up to see Hazel giggling at me with a mean, little grin on her mean, little face. Ever since then, she's made a game of flinging arrows at me just to laugh at my panic. Oh, she's made my work a miserable affair! She's a good shot, though I hate to admit it, but one of these days she's bound to miss her mark and pin an arrow in me!'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:36 2020] Wocas says, 'Athica is well defended. Why haven't haven't you notified the guards of this problem? Surely, they'd help.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:36 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'That was the very first thing I did! But two things are working against me. First, the wretched brownie herself ducks out of view whenever she sees the guards coming. And second, brownie arrows are enchanted to disappear after they hit their mark. With no evidence to show them, the guards won't take my seriously. Half of them think I'm a paranoid milksop and the other half thing I'm trying to get out of my work duties. Curse that Hazel!'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:39 2020] Wocas says, 'Perhaps I can help you.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:39 2020] Caynid Brightwater says, 'You'd do that? I'd be ever so grateful, but what could you possibly do?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:11:40 2020] Wocas says, 'If she's fond of attacking from afar, then I'll give her a dose of her own medicine. Maybe if I rough her up a bit with my magic, I can scare her out of town once and for all.'

[Tue Jul 21 19:44:58 2020] Worchag the Hunter mutters to himself angrily before looking up at you, 'What do you want, High Elf?' He raises a small flask to his lips before taking a long gulp.
[Tue Jul 21 19:44:59 2020] Wocas says, 'Just looking for companionship.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:44:59 2020] Worchag the Hunter snorts, 'Well, look elsewhere! I got myself enough problems.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:01 2020] Wocas says, 'Problems? Maybe I can help.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:01 2020] Worchag the Hunter takes another sip from his flask, 'As you can see, I am a hunter. A hunter from Halas. The best hunter Halas has seen.' He pauses abruptly before sighing and staring into the forest. The breath from his sigh reeks of alcohol.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:02 2020] Wocas says, 'Go on.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:02 2020] Worchag the Hunter says, 'Go on about what?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:04 2020] Wocas says, 'About your pro...'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:04 2020] Worchag the Hunter says, 'Oh yes, my problem! Well you see, High Elf, I am here after a great beast. Big, hulking bear... tall as a horse. The Wood Elves have taken to calling him Gristle. I have spent too long hunting small game outside of Halas to barely make ends meet. The pelt of that beast, Gristle, would buy me a small home and business! No more four-day-long hunting trips. No more being trapped in a tent in the middle of the tundra with other men who have spent the last three days tracking mammoths without a bath or shower. I am going to make hunting finally pay for me. That is why I am here.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:04 2020] He takes another sip of his flask.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:05 2020] Wocas says, 'So, what's the problem? You still have yet to tell me the pro...'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:05 2020] Worchag the Hunter interrupts you angrily, 'I barely got away from the blasted thing with my life! That's the problem! The thing is a Shojar-damned monstrosity!' He takes another swig of his flask before quickly shaking it. The pitiful swishing noise of the last few drops in the container only anger the Barbarian further. 'USELESS!' He throws the flask violently to the forest floor. It lands near his hunting spear, 'And YOU are useless too, you old, stupid spear! Gristle has fangs longer than you!' Worchag pauses, his face twisting from rage to profound thought, 'I need to get more mead...'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:06 2020] Wocas says, 'What if I got you Gristle's pelt?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:06 2020] Worchag the Hunter says, 'You could not be doin' it on your lonesome, laddie!'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:06 2020] Worchag hiccups loudly, 'No. No! I would not want the death of a young High Elf on my conscience. Thank ye, but no.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:08 2020] Wocas says, 'I have friends. You just think about what you're going to do when you get that pelt. I will be back.'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:08 2020] Worchag the Hunter looks disbelievingly, 'Just do not get yourself killed. I am beginning to like you...' He wobbles unsteadily.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:10 2020] Wocas says, 'You will get your hide, Worchag. Worchag...? Are you alright?'
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:10 2020] Worchag the Hunter falls over on his side, snoring loudly.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:12 2020] Bepperino left the zone.
[Tue Jul 21 19:45:14 2020] Worchag the Hunter's mouth falls open as he gathers himself and peers up at the pelt, 'You did it, you little pissant! I cannot believe it! And you are giving it to me? I am speechless, Wocas. Here... it is not much, but it's all I have!' He throws you his adventuring pack before thanking you one last time and departing Kelethin. Judging by its weight, there seems to be something more inside.

[Wed Jul 22 07:54:15 2020] You say, 'Hail, Worchag the Hunter'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:15 2020] Worchag the Hunter mutters to himself angrily before looking up at you, 'What do you want, Human?' He raises a small flask to his lips before taking a long gulp.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:15 2020] - [D1] Just looking for companionship.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:15 2020] - [D2] I just followed the scent of liquor here from the lift. I figured a keg fell down from the city.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:15 2020] - [D3] What is a drunken Barbarian hunter doing in the middle of the elven forest?
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:18 2020] You say, 'Just looking for companionship.'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:18 2020] Worchag the Hunter snorts, 'Well, look elsewhere! I got myself enough problems.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:18 2020] - [D1] Problems? Maybe I can help.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:19 2020] You say, 'Problems? Maybe I can help.'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:19 2020] Worchag the Hunter takes another sip from his flask, 'As you can see, I am a hunter. A hunter from Halas. The best hunter Halas has seen.' He pauses abruptly before sighing and staring into the forest. The breath from his sigh reeks of alcohol.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:19 2020] - [D1] Go on.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] You say, 'Go on.'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] Worchag the Hunter says, 'Go on about what?'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] - [D1] About your pro...
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] You say, 'About your pro...'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] Worchag the Hunter says, 'Oh yes, my problem! Well you see, Human, I am here after a great beast. Big, hulking bear... tall as a horse. The Wood Elves have taken to calling him Gristle. I have spent too long hunting small game outside of Halas to barely make ends meet. The pelt of that beast, Gristle, would buy me a small home and business! No more four-day-long hunting trips. No more being trapped in a tent in the middle of the tundra with other men who have spent the last three days tracking mammoths without a bath or shower. I am going to make hunting finally pay for me. That is why I am here.'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] He takes another sip of his flask.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:20 2020] - [D1] So, what's the problem? You still have yet to tell me the pro...
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:21 2020] You say, 'So, what's the problem? You still have yet to tell me the pro...'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:21 2020] Worchag the Hunter interrupts you angrily, 'I barely got away from the blasted thing with my life! That's the problem! The thing is a Shojar-damned monstrosity!' He takes another swig of his flask before quickly shaking it. The pitiful swishing noise of the last few drops in the container only anger the Barbarian further. 'USELESS!' He throws the flask violently to the forest floor. It lands near his hunting spear, 'And YOU are useless too, you old, stupid spear! Gristle has fangs longer than you!' Worchag pauses, his face twisting from rage to profound thought, 'I need to get more mead...'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:21 2020] - [D1] What if I got you Gristle's pelt?
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:22 2020] You say, 'What if I got you Gristle's pelt?'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:22 2020] Worchag the Hunter says, 'You could not be doin' it on your lonesome, laddie!'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:22 2020] Worchag hiccups loudly, 'No. No! I would not want the death of a young Human on my conscience. Thank ye, but no.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:22 2020] - [D1] I have friends. You just think about what you're going to do when you get that pelt. I will be back.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:23 2020] You say, 'I have friends. You just think about what you're going to do when you get that pelt. I will be back.'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:23 2020] Worchag the Hunter looks disbelievingly, 'Just do not get yourself killed. I am beginning to like you...' He wobbles unsteadily.
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:23 2020] - [D1] You will get your hide, Worchag. Worchag...? Are you alright?
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:24 2020] You say, 'You will get your hide, Worchag. Worchag...? Are you alright?'
[Wed Jul 22 07:54:24 2020] Worchag the Hunter falls over on his side, snoring loudly.
